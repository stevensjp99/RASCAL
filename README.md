# RASCAL
Real Time Atmospheric Science Cluster AnaLysis

Stil a work in progress, little annotation or descriptions in sub-functions etc.

A basic demo of the RASCAL capabilities. Intended to eventually work on-line from live data from scientific instruments RASCAL currently works in a simulated real time environment by passing in data sequentially from a file.
